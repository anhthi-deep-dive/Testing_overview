# Guiding Principles

The more your tests `resemble (giá»‘ng) the way your software is used`, the more confidence they can give you

1. If it `relates to rendering components`, then it should `deal with DOM nodes` rather than component instances

2. It should be generally useful for `testing the application components` in the way `the user would use it`. The utilities `should encourage tests` that use the components the way `they're intended to be used`

3. Utility implementations and APIs should be `simple and flexible`
